## Lead_Final_Project : Automatic Fraud Detection Project

The goal of this project is to :
- Create a fraudulant payment detector and 
- Create an infrastructre that ingest real time payment
- Automatically classify each payment and send back this prediction in real-time to a notification center
- 
Fraud is a huge issue among financial institutions. In the EU in 2019, the European Central Bank estimated that fraudulent credit card transactions amounted more â‚¬1 billion! 

AI can really help solve this issue by detecting fraudulent payments in a very precise manner. This usecase is actually now one of the most famous one among Data Scientists.

However, eventhough we managed to build powerful algorithms, the hard thing is now to use them in production. This means predict fraudulent payment in real-time and respond appropriately.

## Data and real-time payment API
The dataset provided contains a large amount of payments labelled as fraudulent or not. It is used to create the algorithm.

We are also provided an API that retrieves real-time payments. This will be used to create real-time predictions

## Deliverables 

To complete this project, we produced :

- A schema of the infrastructure you chose to build and why you built it that way (available in the Lead_project.pdf)
- The source code of all elements necessary to build our infrastructure
